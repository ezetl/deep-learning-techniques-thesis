## MNIST preliminar experiments

### Steps to reproduce results:

0. Please read Section 3.4 of the [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1505.01596v2.pdf) for further details of the experiment. The steps described here are more helpful if you understand what you are about to do :)

1. Go to `../datasets` and follow the [instructions](../datasets/README.md) to download the MNIST dataset and to create the LMDB

2. Once you have created the proper LMDBs you can run the experiments by running the script `TODO`
